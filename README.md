# Sci-Fi Skirmish
 A Minecraft plugin.

But actually not any Minecraft plugin.
This plugin recreates a PvP-Mode, before seen on Mixelpixel.net

ItÂ´s not actually the mode, wich is called "Westernwars", but heavily inspired by it

Here some things this plugin does:

- Enabling "No-Damage" while wearing a full Protection IV Armor
- Usual QoL Commands, like /feed, /heal, /enderchest and much more
- An own Ecosystem using Experience Bottles as a Ressource

And a lot more...

___
Requieres an SQL Database running (Like you can do with 'phpmyadmin')

- Use `/commands` in Game, to see all the Commands brought by this Plugin and their use (**Cooming Soon!**)
